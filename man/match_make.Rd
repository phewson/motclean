\title{Match vehicle makes from noisy text}
\usage{
match_make(x, strict = 0.08, loose = 0.15, min_mot = 5)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A character vector containing vehicle make and model text.}

\item{strict}{Maximum string distance for automatic acceptance.}

\item{loose}{Maximum string distance for review-level matches.}

\item{min_mot}{Minimum frequency threshold used to distinguish common
vehicles from rare or anomalous entries.}
}
\value{
A character matrix with two rows:
\describe{
\item{make}{Matched canonical make, or \code{"OTHER"}}
\item{status}{One of \code{"ACCEPT"}, \code{"REVIEW"},
or \code{"REJECT"}}
}
}
\description{
Attempts to identify a canonical vehicle make from a noisy free-text
description. Matching is performed using progressive prefix extraction,
approximate string distance, and conservative acceptance thresholds.
}
\details{
The function returns both a matched make and a match status:
\itemize{
\item \code{ACCEPT}: high-confidence automatic match
\item \code{REVIEW}: plausible match requiring review
\item \code{REJECT}: no suitable match (classified as \code{OTHER})
}

The matcher is deliberately conservative: it prefers rejection over
misclassification and is designed to leave rare vehicles, kit cars,
imports, and malformed records unmatched.
