\title{Extract a candidate vehicle make prefix}
\usage{
extract_make_candidate(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A single character string containing a vehicle description.}
}
\value{
A character string representing a candidate make prefix.
}
\description{
Extracts a short prefix from a free-text vehicle description that is likely
to correspond to the vehicle make. The extraction is intentionally
conservative and is designed to operate prior to approximate matching.
}
\details{
The function:
\itemize{
\item standardises text for comparison,
\item removes trailing content beginning with numeric tokens (e.g. model
numbers or engine sizes),
\item returns at most the first three whitespace-separated tokens.
}

This helper does not attempt to identify the correct make on its own; it
merely produces a plausible candidate for downstream matching logic.
